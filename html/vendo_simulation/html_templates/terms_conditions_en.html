<span class="modal_terms_title">General Terms and Conditions of Business and Membership <br />VENDO</span>
<p><strong>Scope </strong></p>
<p>The following General Terms and Conditions of Business and Membership (hereinafter referred to as AGMB or "General Terms and Conditions") shall apply to all contracts between VQualis Limited, Grand Industrial Building, Office 7/F, 159-165 Wo Yi Hop Road, Kwai Chung, Hong Kong (hereinafter referred to as VENDO) and its members (hereinafter referred to as MEMBER or Members). They shall also apply to all future business relations, irrespective of whether or not express reference is made to them again.</p>
<p>VENDO shall not recognise any deviating, conflicting or supplementary general terms and conditions of the Member - even without express objection.</p>
<p><strong> Members of VENDO, Identity </strong></p>
<p>VENDO only concludes contracts with persons of full age and full legal capacity. The offer from VENDO is exclusively extended to independent entrepreneurs and not to consumers. By registering with VENDO, the Member confirms that he/she is an entrepreneur. VENDO reserves the right to request suitable evidence (business registration, excerpts from the commercial register, tax assessment notices) from Members at any time and to exclude Members from further use of VENDO's services if such evidence is not submitted.</p>
<p>The Members work independently. They are responsible for their own tax and social security affairs. In particular, no employment relationship is established by membership status.</p>
<p>The Members must provide all information truthfully. Only one account may be maintained. It is strictly prohibited to provide addresses, names and other details of third parties or companies, service providers, etc. or to register them as beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The contract is concluded online. Transferring the account to third parties is prohibited without prior consent from VENDO.</p>
<p><strong> Services from VENDO</strong></p>
<p>VENDO is an affiliate partner of online broker service providers (hereinafter referred to as Trading Platform) as well as a communication and administration platform, combined with a membership and career system. VENDO arranges contacts with Trading Platforms so that the Member can trade there or the Trading Platform can accept the Member's orders. VENDO only offers to a limited extent and, if necessary, offers possibilities for direct influence on trading transactions (e.g. the possibility of terminating automation from the back office). By means of a career system, VENDO Members can participate in the marketing plan which is referred to and can be viewed on the VENDO website and which is also the subject of the contractual relationship between VENDO and the Member.</p>
<p>In order to be able to be active on the Trading Platform, the Member must conclude an independent contract with the Trading Platform. The legal relationship existing in this respect is exclusively between Members and the Trading Platform. In this respect, VENDO is not a party to the contract. The conclusion of a contract between Members and the Trading Platform may give rise to fees which are to be seen in the information provided on the Trading Platform (see also the section entitled "Fees" below). In this respect, the Members must accept the conditions of the Trading Platform and confirm these.</p>
<p><strong>Rights of Use </strong></p>
<p>All rights to the services provided by VENDO, in particular copyrights, performance protection and trademark rights, above all the programming code, graphics, design, statistics, evaluations, etc., shall remain solely with VENDO. To this extent, the Member shall receive a simple, non-transferable and inalterable right of use, limited to the duration of his or her status as a Member of VENDO, for use in accordance with the contract. If the Member violates his obligations as a member, in particular his obligations described in these Terms and Conditions, the right of use shall expire immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Disclosure and Limitation / Exclusion of Liability</strong></p>
<p>On its platform, VENDO refers to Trading Platforms and transactions and provides information about them. VENDO itself has no influence on these platforms and the business conducted there. In particular, VENDO does not guarantee the achievement of certain goals within the platforms. In particular, VENDO is not liable for any commitments, of whatever kind, which the Trading Platform may promise to the Member.</p>
<p>The Trading Platforms trade complex products that are associated with a significant risk, even of losing money. Past performance is not a reliable indicator for future results. Before the Member decides to trade, he should thoroughly consider his investment objectives, level of experience and risk tolerance. It is strongly advised not to invest more than the Member is willing to lose.</p>
<p>The Member must fully understand the risks of the chosen product and seek further advice if necessary. VENDO shall not express any specific recommendations or trade advice related to the purchase, holding or sale of any product. Above all, VENDO is not a financial advisor.</p>
<p>VENDO shall provide the Member with information and tools which are set up by third parties such as Trading Platforms and which may be come into question as trading opportunities.</p>
<p>VENDO shall not provide consulting services relating to the products and the underlying markets. VENDO assumes no liability for losses resulting from actions of the Member based on this information.</p>
<p>The products offered on the Trading Platforms and the respective underlying markets can be very erratic and unstable as numerous factors can influence market developments. Exchange rates can fluctuate rapidly and change unexpectedly.</p>
<p>VENDO shall only be liable for damages caused by intent or gross negligence and for the breach of substantial contractual obligations, i.e. for all obligations the fulfilment of which makes the proper execution of the contract between VENDO and the Member possible and on the observation of which the Member regularly relies and may rely. VENDO's liability is excluded for other cases of slightly negligent conduct, regardless of the legal grounds. Liability for damages resulting from injury to life, body or health remains unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
<p>Upon opening an account with Vendo, a one-time registration fee and a one-time access fee is charged; the amount of which is indicated on the website during the registration process. The access fee depends in particular on the amount of the selected proposed capital investment. The fees are quoted in USD.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a recurring annual membership fee of currently 99.00 USD will be charged. The payment of the membership fee is a prerequisite for receiving commissions within the framework of the membership.</p>
<p>The Trading Platform charges fees for trading and account management and, if applicable, for other services. Please refer directly to the information on the respective Trading Platform to find out what these fees are and their amounts. When an account is opened, the Trading Platform usually charges a regular performance fee and a management fee.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, the fees of the Trading Platform according to its contractual model are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profit sharing: 35 (Basic), 32 (Plus), 28 (Pro), 25 (Pro+) % of monthly net profit (equity at the end of each month)</li>
<li>Management fee: 0.16 % of the monthly net profit</li>
</ul>
<p>The Member expressly agrees that these fees shall be charged to him/her accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Duties of the Member </strong></p>
<p>VENDO attaches particular importance to transparency, fairness, reliability and legality. For this reason, the Member is subject to strict obligations with regard to, in particular, advertising and activities as a Member of VENDO as well as one&rsquo;s conduct as a Member of VENDO. VENDO places particular emphasis on preventing the membership of VENDO from bold or lurid advertising of the business model.</p>
<p>The Member must always safeguard the interests of VENDO and the other members of VENDO. He must maintain his integrity and act ethically.</p>
<p>To this extent, it is prohibited</p>
<ul>
<li>to brag about earned income, especially in the form of information or screenshots from the back office of the member's account,</li>
<li>to make promises, in particular guarantees on returns, opportunities, etc., with regard to the products traded by the Trading Platforms,</li>
<li>to harass other members or the operators of the Trading Platforms, in particular with regard to topics that are not directly related to the business relationship between the Member and VENDO and/or the Trading Platform,</li>
<li>to accept benefits directly from the Trading Platforms or other contractual partners or to make arrangements to this effect by circumventing VENDO; it is, in particular, prohibited to receive commissions or other monetary benefits in connection with VENDO from the Trading Platforms or other contractual partners of VENDO as a member or even after termination of membership,</li>
<li>to impersonate VENDO or employees of VENDO. When addressing third parties, the Member must always state transparently and clearly that the Members are VENDO members and that their expressions are their own expressions and not those of VENDO,</li>
<li>to use dubious methods such as crossline sponsoring or cross recruiting,</li>
<li>to accept remuneration from third parties for the referral of new Members to VENDO. This also includes the case that the Member has been promised commissions or other monetary benefits for the referral of a business contact or a member to VENDO or the Trading Platform. In the event of a violation, the Member must return these remunerations to VENDO,</li>
<li>to circumvent the aforementioned prohibitions by involving third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to the external appearance and conduct of the Member towards third parties, it is also prohibited</p>
<ul>
<li>to produce advertising materials such as video films and similar media about VENDO,</li>
<li>to advertise VENDO and the activities as a member of VENDO via social media (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter),</li>
<li>to open and maintain chat groups about VENDO and the activities as a member of VENDO via messenger services (e.g. WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram) or via social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>If labels, in particular trademarks, are not used properly, this may, in individual cases, weaken the rights of the owner of the trademark and thus reduce the value of the label or of the trademark owner's company. The rights to trademarks can be impaired not only by improper use by the trademark owner but also by use of the labels by third parties. Furthermore, the use of labels or trademarks by third parties can lead to unintentional confusion and thereby legal uncertainty.</p>
<p>Our aim is, therefore, to protect the reputation of VENDO's trademarks as well as the rights of all parties involved and, to this end, to provide Members with clear and comprehensible guidelines for their use.</p>
<p>All names (e.g. company names, product names), trademarks (in particular registered trademarks), logos and symbols (e.g. company logos, product logos), work titles, business designations and other labels or characteristic signs of VENDO are considered to be trademarks.</p>
<p>Any use of trademarks, whether offline (e.g. in advertising media, in print products) or online (use as links, on websites, in emails, chat groups, forums, etc.) is considered to be use.</p>
<p>All goods, services and other performances which are bought or sold by VENDO itself or by official licensees are considered to be products.</p>
<p>The use of trademarks and references to VENDO or VENDO products are permitted to describe or adequately refer to VENDO or VENDO products. The reference must be truthful and, in particular, must not mislead regarding the status of the Member (e.g. membership status).</p>
<p>References (links) to VENDO and/or its products should refer exclusively to the homepages.</p>
<p>Trademarks may not be used in a way that makes them the most distinctive or prominent feature on third party content (including websites, print and other materials) without prior permission from VENDO.</p>
<p>Trademarks may not be displayed in a way that suggests that VENDO is responsible for their use, i.e. that VENDO composed or arranged for the respective content. The status of the Member must be clearly explained.</p>
<p>It must be made clear by appropriate measures (e.g. distinct visual reference) that any views or opinions expressed in connection with the use of a trademark do not represent the views or opinions of VENDO.</p>
<p>It is not permitted to change trademarks. Any removal, distortion or alteration of the trademark shall be avoided. This also applies, in particular, to the alteration by or use in direct connection with hyphens, compound words or abbreviations.</p>
<p>Trademarks may not be integrated into other signs, specifically third-party signs such as, in particular, company names, logos or trademarks.</p>
<p>Any use of trademarks in a manner that violates the rights of third parties and/or applicable law is prohibited. This includes, in particular, the use in a manner that is misleading, unethical, inappropriate for minors, defamatory, libelous, derogatory, obscene or comparably inappropriate.</p>
<p>The use of signs that are deceptively similar to VENDO's trademarks is prohibited.</p>
<p>VENDO has the right to prohibit the Member from individual uses at any time if violations of these Terms and Conditions exist or are suspected. The same applies if there are doubts as to the compatibility of the use with these guidelines.</p>
<p>The registration and use of domains containing VENDO trademarks is prohibited. This also applies to any domain parking, i.e. the inactive use (e.g. leaving the domain idle) of the domain.</p>
<p>The use of already registered domains must be discontinued immediately. Content shall be placed offline.</p>
<p>VENDO reserves the right to demand the Member to either transfer the domain or to terminate the corresponding registration contracts. The costs shall be borne by the Member.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Member is prohibited from creating landing pages in connection with his or her activity as a Member of VENDO.</p>
<p>In the event of a culpable breach by the Member of his or her obligations described here, the Member shall undertake to pay VENDO a reasonable, legitimate contractual penalty. The contractual penalty shall not be less than 50,000 USD.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality and Secrecy </strong></p>
<p>The Member undertakes to treat all information, documents and business relationships of VENDO that come to their knowledge or are made accessible to them in the course of the cooperation with VENDO with care and in strict confidence and to use them only for contractual purposes. The duty of care and confidentiality shall continue beyond the end of the contract.</p>
<p>Information, in particular regarding VENDO's business model and such information which the Member obtains through his or her activity as a member of VENDO, is strictly confidential. The Member is prohibited from directly or indirectly competing with VENDO and from using confidential information received as a member of VENDO for the benefit of direct or indirect competition with VENDO.</p>
